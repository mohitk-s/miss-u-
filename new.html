          <span>Hey Sapna,</span>
          <br />
          I hope you're doing great. <br />I just wanted to say that I miss you a lot. Things aren't the same without our late-night chats and fun hangouts. Your smile and advice always made my day better, and I really miss that.
          Even though we're far apart, I think about you all the time. I can't wait until we can hang out again and make more memories. Until then, let's keep in touch and stay close.
          Take care, my best friend Sapna. You always have a special place in my heart.
